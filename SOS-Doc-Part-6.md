this is the sixth part in a video series dedicated to building a shopping cart application using blazor webassembly on .net 6. so we have created three workflows let's recap the first workflow involves retrieving products data from the database and displaying the products data to the user in an aesthetically pleasing style the second workflow involves retrieving details for an individual product and displaying the relevant details in an aesthetically pleasing style to the user the third workflow involves the user adding a product to the user's shopping cart and the user being navigated to a screen that displays a list of products contained within the user's shopping cart in this video we'll create the workflow that involves a user removing a product from the user's shopping cart let's get started let's start by implementing the server side code let's go to our shoponline.api project and open the shopping cart repository.cs*

file let's implement the code logic for the delete item method so we can use the id value that will be passed into this method to find the entity that we wish to delete from the cart items database table we are using the find async method to find the relevant entity using the primary key field which is the id field if we find the relevant entity if the item returned from the find async method is not null we can use the remove method to remove the relevant entity from the cart items database table then we mustn't forget to call the save changes async method to commit the relevant change to our database in order to make this delete functionality available to calling client code let's create an appropriate endpoint within our web api component so let's go to the shopping cart controller class and create an appropriate action method that will call the relevant delete item method that we have just implemented in the shopping cart repository class let's decorate our delete item action method with an attribute that declares that this action method corresponds to the http delete verb*

*Blazor Web Assembly is a `Single page app framework` for building `interective` `client side` `web app`s with `dot net`. It uses `open Web standard` without `plugin or recompiling code` into other languages. This Course will teach you how to use `balzor web assembly` & `web api` on .Net 6 . We will build step by step a `shopping Cart Application`. We also provide the guide on how to `intigrate a payment gateway` into our `blazor web Assembly` component so that a user able to pay for products through our application using a `debit or credit card` or in the `paypal account`.*

*please join us  as we built the very basic `shopping Cart Application` using `blazor web assembly`. A few of the significant technology we'll use for building our application are as follow. The latest version of `visual studio`, which is `visual studio 2022`. and we'll use the community edition for windows. .net 7 which is at the time of creating this project the latest version of dotnet. It was released in June of 2022 Pre 5. Sql Server 2019, Blazor Web assembly, we'll use bootstrap version 5 for layout & styling purposes. We'll build the `restful MVC Web Api project` for handling database related functionality & returning relavent data from the `server` to our client side blazor application. All technology is used for the development of this application can be downloaded free of charge. Please see below in the description the location of where u're able to download the relavent technology is for free. We're going to integrate a payment gateway powered by paypal into our application. So that a user can use their paypal account or a valid debit or credit card to pay for the items that all purchase through our online shopping cart application.*

*Blazor is a relatively new feature of ASP.NET. It offers two `hosting model`. A 'server side hosting model` &  a 'client side hosting model'. We are going to use the 'client side hosting model' for the development of our shopping cart application. The significanse of this `hosting model` is that the C# code runs directly within our `browsers`. What makes this possible is a technology named `Web Assembly`. In recent years the creation of `SPA applications` or `single page applications` have become very popular as `web solutions`. Recently `Javascript frameworks like Angular or React` have been the avilable choices for the creation of `spa applications`. With Blazor we are now able to create our `single page applications using C#`. We don't necessaryly need to depend on  javascript for the creation of our interective UI Code. We can create this code using `C#`. In this appliaction however the `payment gateway` provided by `paypal` is coded in `javascript`. So we will use blazor into our probality funtionality with javascript to interect with the relavent javascript paypal code.*

*So lets get started. Let's create our blazor solutions. Let's fire up visual studio 2022. Select create new project. Le's choose the appropriate project template. Blazor Web Assembly App. Let's name our solution `ShopOnlineSolution`. Let's name the blazor project ShopOnline.Web. great. Lets add a new project to our solutions where we'll create out restful web api funtionality. So lets ensure that we choose the correct project template. Lets name our project ShopOnline.Api. Notice that for the authentication type we're choosing none. We are not going to implement `membership` functionality. which ofcourse include `login & registration functionality`. We're focus purely on the Shopping Cart Funtionality. We want to run our application on latest version of dot net, .net 6. note that we're enable `OpenApi` support. By doing this the `Swashbuckle NuGet Package` will be automatically installed & the appropriate `swagger middleware` will be automatically configured appropiately within our project. One of the advatages of this is when we run our Web Api project interectively we'll be able to test our web Api code through our browsers even before we've developed any front-end code. So the basic UI will automatically be created for this purpose for us. When we run our application interectevly we'll be able  to test each of our `action methods` through the relavent automatically created web based UI. Note that u can also use a tool like `postman` to test a web api funtionality. I going to be using postman during the development of this application.*

*We are going to build our database using `code first migrations` & `entity framework` core. Migration allow us to evolve our database without using data or database object. So by using plain all `C# classes` we can build the `database entites` that we wish to include within our Shopping Cart Application. Once we've created relavent entity related C# classes we're look at an entity relationship diagram that represent our shopping cart application database design. Lets add a folder name Entities to our project. This is where the classes that will represant our database entities will reside. So lets create a class name cart to represant the cart entity. so lets add two public property to this class id as integer & userid as integer. lets add a new class name cartitem. this entity represents an item that has been added to the user shopping cart. So lets add an integer property name id, lets add an integer property name cartid. This property represents a foreign key field. & is used to join the cart entity to the cart item entity. so the cart entity has a one to many relationship with the cartitem entity. this is to note that many cartitem can be included with in one particular shopping cart. Lets include an integer property name ProductId. lastly lets include a integer property name Qty represanting a quantity or number of a particular product that may be included within a particular shopping cart. lets create a new class represant the product entity. the product entity will have a one to many relationship with the cart item entity. This to note that a product can be included many types across many different shopping carts. lets add an integer property name Id. lets add a string property name Description. lets add a string property name ImageURL. Lets create a property of type decimal named price. lets create a property of type integer named Qty. Lastly let's add a property of type integer name CategoryId. The CategoryId property represents foreign key from the ProductCategory Entity. The code for which we're about to implement. So let's create a class named productCategory. This entity has a one to many relationship with the product entity. Let's add a public property name Id. Note that when a property is named Id by convention entity framework core will designate the Id Property as representative of the relavant entity's primary key. Let's add a property of type string and name this property Name And lastly let's create a class to represent our user entity which of course represents a user of our application. Note that i've included this entity as a temporary substitute for a membership facility like for exemple microsoft identity So that we can focus on the shopping cart workflows and not be distracted by the membership functionality. So let's add an integer property named Id. Let's add a string property named UserName. So If we look at the entity relationship diagram [Visit Here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/969fa12e-1cb2-49bf-9e2d-3a89accc11ab/edit?viewport_loc=-65%2C-11%2C1707%2C872%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_534ffb26-27c6-4037-99ad-da8d6e9f0aa2#) We can see the relationship s between our entities.*

*The cart entity has a one to many relationship with the CartItem entity. The Product entity has a OneToMany relationship with the CartItem Entity.The product category entity has a OneToMany relatioship with the Product Entity. The User Entity has OneToOne relationship with the Cart entity. So the basically means each user can only have one Shopping Cart Within our application. If you look at the Sql Server management studio that is installed on my local machine. You can see that i've already generated a database through ef7. This was done when i was developing the protottype for this application. So we're now going to use ef7 to generate a database for our Shgopping Cart Application. The classes we've just created representing our Entities will be used by ef7 to generate the corresponding database tables within a database that ef7 will create for us. In order to generate our database with the relevent tables through visual studio lets install two nuget packages. To do this right click the dependencies node within our ShopOnline.Api Project. Click the manage new get package menu item. Click the browser tab on the new get package manager dialog. Lets search for `Entity Framework Core Sql Server` & this is the package we want to install. Lets Click the install button then i accept button. Great. Let's search for the second package that we need to install the reason we're installing this package is because we want to run our migrations from with in visual studio as opposed to using The .Net CLI for this purpose. Note that you would use different commands when running migrations commands using the .Net CLI as opposed to the commands you would run when using visual studio. So Let's search for EntityFarameworkCore.Tools & this is the package we want. Let's install the mocrosoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools Nuget Package.The next step is we must configure a connection string in order to connect our application with the database that we wish to create using ef7 Code first migrations.*

*So Lets open the appsettings.json file within our shopOnline.Web Project. Within the Connectionstrings that i'm configuring here i'm including my server name which is DEBASISPAULPC. The  database which i wish to name ShopOnline & we're going to use a Trusted_Connection to connect our Shopping Cart Applications web api to our database. So let's include Trusted_Connection=True within our ConnectionStrings. Note that i've named my Connectionstrings ShopOnlineConnection Let's create our DatabaseContext Class. Let's first create a folder named data within our ShopOnline.Api Project. Let's add a class named ShopOnlineDbContext to our new data folder. So in order to make this class represant our ef7 database context we need to implement code so that our `ShopOnlineDbContext` Class inherits from ef7 DbContext class. An red squigly line under `DbContext` this is because we've an important `Microsoft.EntityFramewokCore` Namespace. An easy way to include the appropriate using directive through visual studio is to press `Ctr+Period` & then select the appropriate menu item from the menu that is presented to us through Visual Studio. Let's Create the Constructor for our `ShopOnlineDbContext` Class. We must add a parameter to to the constructor that we've just generated. The parameter is name `Options` & is of the generic type `DbContextOptions` which has the data type `ShopOnlineDbContext` Passed as an argument to it. We can then write code to pass the argument that will be passed to our `ShopOnlineDbContext` Class Constructor to the base class from which Inherit IE. the DbContext class. Now because We want to focus on the shopping cart workflow at the stage & don't want us to distructed by the implementation of administrative CRUD operation functionality. We are going to seed our database with certain data. This is data that we already prepared. So we're not going to include `Create Read Update & delete` Funtionality regarding the creation & maintenance of product data. At the stage we are going to seed our database with product related data. We're going to seed our database with the relavent data so that we can move directly to the creation of our shopping cart functionality. So in order to seed database appropriately we can override a method that exist  within the DbContext based class. This method is named `OnModelCreating` An easy way to generate the relavent override code for this method through visual studio is to type in the word `override` & then press the space bar. We can Insulate The `OnModelCreating` item. From the drop down list presented in us with in visual studio. I've already prepared the code for seeding our database and this code can be found at this location on github.So lets go to the appropriate github location. & copy this codes to our clipboards. Lets then paste the code from our clipboards into the OnModelCreatring method.*

*The next step is to let ef7 know as it were about our entities. So we can do this by using the entity framework core DbSet Generic type. So for each of our entities we need to appropriately include a public property of type DbSet within our ShopOnlineDbcontetxt class. To register our ShopOnlinedbcontext class for dependency injection let's open the relavent Program.cs file. Then we can simply add this code here to register our ShopOnlineDbContext Class for dependency injection. Note that our code is reading the connection string that we configuredin the appsettings.json file. We're now ready to generate a migration using ef7. So lets launch the NuGet Package Manager Console Window from within visual studio like this.  We can type the appropriate command to generate a migration. So lets type in add-migration followed by the name of the migration we wish to create.*

*So when i run the add-migration command i get an exception. I've found out that this exception occured because at present the ShopOnline.Web Project is set to my startup project within the relavent solution. So if you get this exception all you need to do to fix this is make the ShopOnline.Api project your startup project like this. So Let's try again and now we dont't get the exception  and it works  as expected and you can see the up method of the migration class that we've just generated .This code create the relavent tables .This method also contains code that seeds the relavent database tables with the data that i prepared prior to creating this project. The down method contains code to undo the changes made by code contained within the up method.*

*To run our migration all we need to do type the update-database Command within the Nuget Package manager console Window Like this and then of course press enter and now if we look at Sql Server Management Studio we can see that the ShopOnline Database has been created. Check SSMS 19 Prev 2. We can see that the ShopOnline Database has been Created. The database table have been appropriately created based on the entities we created using C# classes. The relavent database tables have been seeded with the data created from the code we included with in the `OnModelCreating` method. Which was resides with in the `ShopOnlineDbContext` class. The data with which we've seeded our database contains product & User Information. This is been done. so that we can focus on the shopping cart functionality & not worried  at this stage about implementing code or `Creat Read Update & Delete` Functionality regrading products sold by our fictional online store.*

*Here are just few notes about running migrations. Please note that if u have one migration or more than one migration & are not happy with the changes made to the database u can undo the changes made by running this command `update-database 0` The number Zero is a special case that means before the first migration & causes the effects of all migrations to be rolled back. You may wish To Remove the migrations after this. You can remove a migration that has not yet been used to update the database by running the command `remove-migration`. The remove-migration command will remove the last migration that has not yet run. Note that if for example you have Upadate a database with multiple migrations Like `Migration1 or Migration2 or Migration3 or Migration4 or Migration5`.  & if u wish to rollback the changes to before a particular migration was run you can Rollback your changes to that particular state by running the migration that was run directly before the migrations that were run that contain the changes you wish to roll back `update-database Migration2`*

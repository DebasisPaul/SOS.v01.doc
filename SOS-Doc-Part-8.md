this is the eighth part of a video series dedicated to building a shopping cart application using blazerwebassemblyon.net 6. so at this point we have achieved quite a lot we have created the functionality for displaying grouped products to the user we have also created most of the functionality for the shopping cart 
a user can now add a product to the shopping cart remove a product from the shopping cart and can update the quantity of a product that is contained within the shopping cart so we now need a way for a user to be able to navigate to the shopping cart from anywhere within the application we also want the user to be able to see at a glance how many items are currently contained within the user's shopping cart currently the user is only able to navigate to the shopping cart through our application by adding a product to the shopping cart we want the user to be able to see how many items have been added to the user's shopping cart at a glance no matter where the user is within the application for example the user may be viewing the grouped products displayed to the user when the application is first launched and wishes to know how many items are currently contained within the user's shopping cart we also want the user to be able to navigate to the user's shopping cart through our application from anywhere within the application simply by clicking a button so we want to make this button accessible to the user from anywhere in the application so in this video we'll provide an appropriate solution for this we'll provide a button in the header part of the ui that when clicked will navigate the user to the user's shopping cart the quantity of items stored within the user's shopping cart will be displayed on the text of the relevant button so the quantity value displayed on the relevant button must be kept up to date so we must facilitate the change of the relevant quantity value whenever the number of items within the shopping cart changes the code for the button containing the text representing the number of items in the user's shopping cart will be*

contained within its own razor component a razor component we'll name cart menu so this means we need to find a way to send data to the cart menu razor component from other relevant razer components like for example the shopping cart razor component whereby code must execute that updates the relevant quantity value when a change to the number of items stored within the user's shopping cart is made in this video we'll see how c-sharp events can be used to facilitate communication of data between the loosely coupled razor components within our application right let's get started let's go to our blazer client component so let's go to the project named shoponline.web let's open the i shopping cart service file let's create a definition for a c-sharp event note that the action type is a delegate that doesn't return a value so any method that the relevant delegate points to will be able to accept the arguments defined within the relevant delegate but the method will not return a value in our case any method pointed to by this delegate will accept one argument of type integer let's create a definition for a method that is responsible for raising the*

relevant event to subscribed components if what we are doing here is unclear to you don't worry it will become clearer to you as we develop the code in this video okay so let's open the shopping cart service file let's implement the code for the interface items that we have just created let's implement the code for the raise event on shopping cart changed method first we need to check if our event has any subscribers we can do this by evaluating the on shopping cart changed event object so if the on shopping cart changed object is not null this means that the event has subscribers so if the event has subscribers*

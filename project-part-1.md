*00:00 - 00:50 Blazor Web Assembly is a Single page app framework for building interective client side web apps with dot net. It uses open Web standard without plugin or recompiling code into other languages. This Course will teach you how to use balzor web assembly & web api on .Net 7 . We will build step by step a shopping Cart Application. We also provide the guide on how to intigrate a payment gateway into our blazor web Assembly component so that a user able to pay for products through our application using a debit or credit card or in the paypal account.  [SPA (Single-page application)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)*

*Blazor is a relatively new feature of asp dot net. It offers two hosting model. A server side hosting model &  a client side hosting model. We are going to use the client side hosting model for the development of our shopping cart application. The significanse of this hosting model is that the C# code runs directly within our browsers. What makes this possible is a technology named `Web Assembly`. In recent years the creation of SPA applications or single page applications have become very popular as web solutions. Recently Javascript frameworks like Angular or React have been the avilable choices for the creation of spa applications. With Blazor we are now able to create our single page applications using C#. We don't necessaryly need to depend on  javascript for the creation of our interective UI Code.
We can create this code using C#. In this appliaction however the payment gateway provided by paypal is coded in javascript. So we will use blazor into our probality funtionality with javascript to interect with the relavent javascript paypal code. 02:08 - 03:20*

*03:20 - 04:16Add a new Blazor Web Assembly App Project. A project template for creating a Blazor app that runs on WebAssembly and is optionally hosted by an ASP.NET Core app. This template can be used for web apps with rich dynamic user interfaces (UIs)*

*Add a new ASP.NET Core Web API Project Template (A project template for creating an ASP.NET Core application with an example Controller for a RESTful HTTP service. This template can also be used for ASP.NET Core MVC Views & Controllers)*

*We Enable `OpenAPI` support. By doing this the `Swashbuckle` NuGet Package will be automatically installed & the appropriate swagger middleware will be automatically configured appropiately within our project. One of the advatages of this is when we run our Web Api project interectively we'll be able to test our web Api code through our browsers even before we've developed any front-end code. So the basic UI will automatically be created for this purpose for us. When we run our application interectevly we'll be able  to test each of our action methods through the relavent automatically created web based UI. 04:17- 05:52*

*We are going to build our database using code first migrations & entity framework core [2]. Migration allow us to evolve our database without using data or database object. So by using plain all C# classes we can build the database entites that we wish to include within our Shopping Cart Application. Once we've created relavent entity related C# classes we're look at an entity relationship diagram that represent our shopping cart application database design. 6.16 - 6.43* 

*Create Entities Related C# Clases. This is way the classes that represent out database entities will resign. [Microsoft identity platform documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/)*

*Using  ef7 to generate a database for our shopping cart application. The classes that we've just crated representing our entities will be used by ef7 to generate the corresponding database table within the database that ef7 create for us. In order to generate our database with the relavent tables through Visual Studio Let's Install two Nuget Packages, `EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` `EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` for running migrations within visual studio. The reason for installing `EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` this package is because we want to run our migration with in the visual studio as supposed to using .Net CLI for this purpose. We can use different commands when running migration commands using the .Net CLI. As supposed to the command we run when using Visual Studio. 11.56- 14.08 Configuring Connection String in order to connect the application with the database that we wish to create using ef7 code first migrations. 14.22- 15.20 [Connection Strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-strings)*

*15.21-Create Database Context Class. So in order to make this class represant our ef7 databse context we need to implement code so that our `ShopOnlineDbContext` Class inherits from ef7 DbContext class. An red squigly line under `DbContext` this is because we've an important `Microsoft.EntityFramewokCore` Namespace. An easy way to include the appropriate using directive through visual studio is to press `Ctr+Period` & then select the appropriate menu item from the menu that is presented to us through Visual Studio. Let's Create the Constructor for our `ShopOnlineDbContext` Class. We must add a parameter to to the constructor that we've just generated. The parameter is name `Options` & is of the generic type `DbContextOptions` which has the data type `ShopOnlineDbContext` Passed as an argument to it. We can then write code to pass the argument that will be passed to our `ShopOnlineDbContext` Class Constructor to the base class from which Inherit IE. the DbContext class. Now because We want to focus on the shopping cart workflow at the stage & don't want us to distructed by the implementation of administrative CRUD operation functionality. *An Easy way to automaically generate a Constructor within visual studio is type `ctor` & then press the tab key twice. Then in order to indicate to .Net that we want an object of type ShopOnlineDbContext to be injected into this constructor only need to do is difine an parameter with in our constructor of type ShopOnlineDbContext.* [DbContext Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.entity.dbcontext?view=entity-framework-6.2.0, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/ef6/fundamentals/working-with-dbcontext) [Passing Parameters (C# Programming Guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/passing-parameters) [Constructors (C# programming guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors) [Generic type parameters (C# Programming Guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-type-parameters, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/generics) [Inheritance in C# and .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/inheritance)*

*`OnModelCreating Method Overriding`  We are going to seed our database with certain data. This is data that we already prepared. So we're not going to include Create Read Update & delete Funtionality regarding the creation & maintenance of product data. At the stage we are going to seed our database with product related data. We're going to seed our database with the relavent data so that we can move directly to the creation of our shopping cart functionality. So in order to seed database appropriately we can override a method that exist  within the DbContext based class. This method is named `OnModelCreating` An easy way to generate the relavent override code for this method through visual studio is to type in the word `override` & then press the space bar. We can Insulate The `OnModelCreating` item. From the drop down list presented in us with in visual studio. [Data Seeding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/data-seeding) [override (C# reference)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/override) [Creating and configuring a model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/)*

*19.57`Using Entity Framework Core DbSet Generic Type` So for each of our entities we need to appropriately include a public property of type `DbSet` with in our `ShopOnlineDbContext` Class. [DbSet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.entity.dbset?view=entity-framework-6.2.0) 20.50 `Register ShopOnlineDbContext class for Dependency Injection` Lets open the relavent program.cs file. [Dependency injection in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) [Dependency injection in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-6.0)*

*21.22 `Generating Migration Using ef7` Open NuGet Package Manager Console Window. Follow with this Command `Add-Migration InitiaCreate` ShopOnline Api project Set as Startup Project. By generating this migration class this code generate our database & the relavent table. This method also contain code that seeds the relavent database table with the data that prepared prair to create in this project.*

*23.47 `To run migration type update-database Command in Nuget PM console Window.` Check SSMS 19 Prev 2. We can see that the ShopOnline Database has been Created. The database table have been appropriately created based on the entities we created using C# classes. The relavent database tables have been seeded with the data created from the code we included with in the `OnModelCreating` method. Which was search with in the `ShopOnlineDbContext` class. The data with which we've seeded our database contains product & User Information. This is been done. so that we can focus on the shopping cart functionality & not worried  at this stage about implementing code `Creat Read Update & Delete` Functionality regrading products sold by our frictional online store.*

*24.56 `Running Migrations Notes:` if u have one migration or more than one migration & not happy with the changes made to the database u can undo the changes made by running this command `update-database 0` The number Zero is a special case that means before the first migration & causes the effects of all migration to be rolled back. To Remove migration run this command `remove-migration` if you Upadate a database with multiple migrations Like `Migration1 or Migration2 or Migration3 or Migration4 or Migration5`. if u wish to rollback the changes to before a particular migration was run you can Rollback your changes to that particular state by running the migration that was run directly before the migration that back contain the changes you wish to roll back `update-database Migration2`*

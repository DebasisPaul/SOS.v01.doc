this is the seventh part of a video series dedicated to building a shopping cart application using blazerwebassemblyon.net 6. so in the previous part of this series we created functionality whereby a user can delete an item from the user's shopping cart in this video we are going to create the functionality whereby a user is able to update the quantity of a particular product that has been placed within the user's shopping cart a notable feature that we'll add is the showing and hiding of the update qty button so we only want the update qty button to appear when the user changes the appropriate value in the field denoting the quantity of a particular item in the user's shopping cart when the relevant field is changed the relevant update qty button appears once the user has clicked the update qty button to update the quantity of a particular item in the user's shopping cart we want the update qty button to disappear to achieve the appropriate showing and hiding of the update qty button we are going to invoke a javascript method this brings us to an important question how do we integrate javascript into our blazer webassembly component in this video we are going to look at how we can use blaze's javascript*

interoperability feature to interact with javascript code from within our blazer webassembly component we'll implement this functionality toward the end of the video so please stick around to the end to learn about javascript interoperability with blazer to start with let's create the server-side code for the update qty functionality so let's get started let's go to the shoponline.api project let's open the shopping cart repository class let's implement the code logic for the update qty method first thing to do is reference the item that we wish to update so if we are able to find the relevant item within our database and therefore the item variable will not be null we can then update the qty field with the value passed in from the cl*

*1:40:00 So this is the fourth part of the series of project dedicated to building a shoping cart application on dotnet 7 prev 5. using blazor web assembly & web api. We're now created our first workflow which involved retrieving product data form the database & displaying the data to the user in an aesthetically pleasing style. We have built our database using Ef7. We've implemented code using the `Repository Design Pattern` within a web api component in order to return products data from our database to a calling client. In the last part of this series part-3 we implemented code for our blazor web assembly component to call an appropriate action method within our web api component using a `http get request` in order to retrieve product data from the server and display the data to the user in an aesthetically pleasing style. We want to create functionality to retrieve data for a specific product from the server and display the details of that product to the user. So when the user clicks on a particular product only the details for that specific product are displayed to the user. The user can then decide whether or not to add the product to the user's shopping cart. A button will be provided within the razor component responsible for displaying the relavent products details whereby a user can click this button and add the relavent product to the users shopping cart. we'll implement the code for the add to cart button in the next Part.*

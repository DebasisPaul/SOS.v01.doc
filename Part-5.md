This is the fifth part in a video series dedicated to building a shopping cart application using blazor web assembly on .net 6. so we have completed the implementation of two workflows `the first workflow involves retrieving the data pertaining to the products sold by our online store and `displaying the data in an aesthetically pleasing style to the user` `the second workflow involves displaying details for a particular product to the screen in response to the user clicking on a card representing the relevant product`. In this video we'll create the functionality whereby the user clicks the add to cart button which is available on the screen where details for a particular product are displayed this button click action will result in the relevant product being added to the
user's shopping cart after the user has clicked the add to cart button the user will subsequently be navigated to a screen that displays data pertaining to the products currently contained within the user's shopping cart*

so let's get started so let's first implement the functionality for the server side code. so let's go to our project that contains the functionality for our web api component. in the second part of this video series we implemented the repository design pattern for functionality to handle database interactions regarding the products sold by our online store. so we now want to create the code for handling the database functionality pertaining to the shopping cart so let's create an interface that contains the method definitions for the shopping cart repository class that we'll create once we have created its interface so let's create an interface named i shopping cart repository let's create a method definition for a method named add item as the name suggests the code that we'll implement for this method will add a particular product to the relevant user's shopping cart let's add a method definition for a method named update qty when a user first adds a product to the user's shopping cart*

the quantity of the relevant product added to the user's shopping cart will be won by default the implementation for this method will involve updating the quantity of a particular product that is currently contained within a user's shopping cart let's add a method definition for a method named delete item as the name suggests the functionality for this method will involve removing a particular product from the user's shopping cart the get item method will contain functionality for retrieving data regarding a particular product that is currently in the user's shopping cart the get items method will contain functionality for retrieving data for all the products that are currently in a particular user's shopping cart so let's create a class named shopping cart repository 
let's write codes to implement the i shopping cart repository interface that we have just created let's position our mouse pointers appropriately and press control period in order to bring in the appropriate namespace ie where the i shopping cart repository interface resides*

*2:10:43
let's press control period and generate the code staffs for the method definitions that we included within the i shopping cart repository interface so in this video we are going to implement functionality for three of the methods that we have defined within the i shopping cart repository interface namely add item get items and get item before we do this let's create a constructor let's add a parameter to our constructor that is of type shop online db context by including this parameter we are indicating to .net that we want an object of this type injected into our shopping cart repository class at runtime we have already registered the shop online db context type for dependency injection the shop online db context type is the ef core database context object that is used for handling data manipulation and data retrieval functionality in relation to our applications database*
